WIP

Clean dark color-coded theme without bullshit:

* No italic
* No bold
* No underlining (except links)
* Good contrast
* ~~Bugs fixed, PRs merged, etc~~

Focuses mostly (but not entirely) on editor colors, the rest are defaults
(default dark or something). Inspired by [One Monokai][] theme, but instead
of blending One Dark and Monokai, it blends default dark, Monokai Dimmed
and Monokai (and a little bit of One Dark, it's complicated).

Editor colors derived from [Monokai Pro][]:

* Black: `#2c292d`
* White: `#fcfcfa`
* Red: `#ff6188`
* Green: `#a9dc76`
* Yellow: `#ffd866`
* Orange: `#fc9867`
* Magenta: `#ab9df2`
* Cyan: `#78dce8`

Derived from Monokai Dimmed:

* Comments color: `#9a9b99`
* Some other UI colors too (status bar, etc)

Tested on C++, also Lua, Markdown will get some love (not too much) later.
Other languages might work too, i don't know.
