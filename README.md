WIP

Clean, clear, dark, color-coded theme without bullshit:

* No italic
* No bold
* No underlining (except links)
* Good contrast
* ~~Bugs fixed, PRs merged, etc~~

Focuses mostly (but not entirely) on editor colors, the rest are defaults
(default dark or something). Inspired by [One Monokai][] theme, but instead
of blending One Dark and Monokai, it blends Default Dark, Monokai Dimmed
and Monokai (and a little bit of One Dark, it's complicated).

Tested on C++, Lua, Markdown will also get some love (not too much).
Shell seems to work fine too, as well as GLSL, but don't quote me
on that.

Other languages might also work, i don't know. Theme isn't tailored for
any particular language specifically, but it has quirks for C++ and
Lua here and there.
